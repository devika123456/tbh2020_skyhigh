3. Name of project

   Introduction to Automatic Railway Gate Control

4. One liner for project

   Automatize the railway crossings in order to avoid accidents due to human negligence.

5. Which sdg does your project align with? 

  No poverty and Infrastructure

6. Write a short description of your project.  

   In general, Railway gates are opened and closed manually by the gatekeeper.Some railway crossings are totally unmannered and many railway accidents
occur at these unmannered level crossings.To avoid the human intervention our project (Automated railway gate controlsystem is very useful which helps to automatically open and close the railway gateupon arrival and departure of the train.

7. What does your project solve? 

   Through this prototype is simple to build and highly reliable but there’re some obstacles too. Rather than a train if an animal or other object is
placed in front of the IR sensor the alarm will and the gate will be closed which is not desirable at all.Also other natural obstacles like fogmay arise problems. 28 There’re also a scope of alerting the nearestrailway station about arrival and departure of the train.

8. Challenges you ran into during the hackathon.  

   Competetiveness,time span
